# Ghost-Detector API üéÉüëª

### Welcome, fearless humans (and sneaky ghosts)!  

Halloween is here, and with it comes the most important question of our time: Are there ghosts lurking around, watching your every move? Worry no more, because **Ghost-Detector** has you covered! Whether you're a human trying to avoid spectral surprises or a ghost in need of some human hunting, this API has everything you need. This cutting-edge (and definitely *not* haunted) service is the perfect solution to detect spooky spirits or to give ghosts some much-needed help in avoiding humans (we can be scarier than they think).

### Once upon a full moon night...
In a world where humans and ghosts coexist, there's always been tension. Ghosts, forever curious about our world, love to peek at us from beyond the veil. Meanwhile, humans, unaware of their transparent neighbors, walk around oblivious. But no more! This Halloween, we bridge the ghost-human gap with **Ghost-Detector**‚Äîthe only API that caters to *both* realms!  

It's the perfect tool for those who want to keep their Halloween spooky but not *too* spooky. Whether you're a human looking to stay ghost-free or a ghost avoiding nosy humans, this API is for you!
